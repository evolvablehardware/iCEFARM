# Pulse count over usbip
Connect to a device with the usbip client, then upload pulse counting firmware. Performs a loop of creating a clock bitstream, uploading it to the fpga, then logging the resulting pulses. Requires the oss-cad-suite. Also requires creating symlinks for the pico-sdk and pico-ice-sdk in the firmware directory.
